# Amazon Routing Dashboard

### This project uses the dataset from the 2021 Amazon Last Mile Routing Research.  With the dataset, I extracted the data from 10 routes in the S3 bucket. I transformed the data to be able to be used by the Google Matrix API, to calculate route distance and time, and to display the locations on a map using Folium. I loaded the data into a sqlite database which allows for filtering routes by city.
